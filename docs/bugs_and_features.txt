Bug Fixes:
The fibo shows from both the tends, sometimes the top is 100% while other times it is 0%
-- in ML training the features are same but for different cuts, the normalization mean median are different so is the normalized values, which cause all the issue


Features

Ensemble 9 models
3 Model 1d@1% — large sample, captures intraday/very short momentum, high recall, noisy but frequent. Good for flow and volume.

3 models 3d@3% — medium-term momentum, fewer positives, better signal/noise ratio, good per-trade returns.

3 models 5d@5% — rarer, high-confidence moves; good for picking larger trends and spikes.

Together they cover multiple time scales and trade sizes. Ensembleing them lets you harvest both frequency (1d) and magnitude/confidence (5d).
