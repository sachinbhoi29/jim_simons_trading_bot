We are detecting regimes and then applying best strategy as jim simons did


What if we use brutforce approach
what if I calculate 100 indicators and when 80-85 indicators are bullish then I buy?
VS
use the best indicators according to regimes


I have news sentiment analysis, now, what I want is, news sentiment change over time, to detect how the news are chaning
only that part is pending from the indicators side

combine both NIFTY and BANKNIFTY



Even better: Cluster models (Sector-based)
Instead of 1 model per stock, train 1 model per sector:
Banks (BankNifty)
IT
Pharma
FMCG
Metals
Auto
Energy
Midcaps
✔ much more data
✔ similar behavior within sectors
✔ less overfit
✔ still tailored

Yes — you absolutely can compute:
Correlation of each stock with NIFTY / BANKNIFTY, and
Find clusters of similar-behaving stocks (based on returns, volatility, beta, etc.)

we have so many new parameters for backtesting now, bracket order, use them later

adding sector as a feature failed because the data might not be that great
