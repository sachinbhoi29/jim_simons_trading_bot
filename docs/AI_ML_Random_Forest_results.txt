Seen data vs unseen data

What I understood was that, the  threshold is the precentage of confidance we give, so do not compare it with
recall, recall can vary as very low row can satisy the 70% criteria and you will think recall is low.
So always keep the threshold high, only then you will get quality trade, refardless of the how many trades we got

If your average winning trade is +9%, that is extremely, extremely good
