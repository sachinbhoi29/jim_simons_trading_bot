Bought on 61%, I get 2*times profit at level 0.786 on 30th day,
But I get 1.39*times reward on the next day at level 0.382

LT.ns
It came down to beteween 0.5 to 0.61 level and then rebound to 0.38 and then down wave

Let's change strategy to enter trade just above 0.61 level and then exit just above 0.382 and stop loss just above 0.786

Bought just above 61%, made profit just above 0.382 around 1.16 risk reward, in 1 day

LT also worked
1.22 risk reward, bought above 0.618 and above, then sold just above 0.382 and stop loss above 0.786 in 3 days

Bought just above 0.61 level, solve just above 0.382 and stop loss as 0.786, target hit on 3rd day

BOB bought just above 0.618, respect on that level, just brushed the 0.382 level and then took downturn
This should be sign, that it couldn't even reach 0.382, then it will go bearish
Hit stop loss on 10th day



Let's try on NIFTY Bullish, 
2024-12-03 to 2024-12-30
No good stock found

2024-07-10
