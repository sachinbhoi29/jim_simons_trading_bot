We will have a feature branch
new feature will be developed in that branch
the lifecycle of that feature starts from the dev, then uat and then prod
once the feature is finalized, and tested, only then it can go to the main code

So, each feature will have it's own branch and it will be created in feature folder
example:- features/news-trading/dev/, uat/,prod

dev:
all development work will be in dev

uat:
once you think this code is working and good, it will be moved to uat

prod:
This is the code which actually has value in the product. so, any code which will bring value to the product, will come 
here. and it will go to main code.
For example there is some working code but is not useful, it will stay in UAT

File naming conventions:

while development, give the files A, B, C onwards name for same category
and each step, can be given _1,_2,_3 name
For eample: there is market generic news and stocks news, so market news file name can start with A, and stocks can start with B
or maintain seperate folder
and steps, like step 1 and 2 will have _1 and _2 at the end

use snake case for class names
use all caps for constant
